## Introduction

Meteor showers are natural astronomical events that can be breathtaking to observe. However, visibility can be heavily influenced by weather conditions. This project utilizes historical weather data and meteorite landing data to predict the likelihood of clear visibility during meteor showers in different cities.

## Features

- **Data Integration**: Merges meteorite landing data with historical weather data.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes Random Forest Classifier for predicting visibility.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Provides a list of cities with the best conditions for viewing meteor showers.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handles missing data and prepares the dataset for analysis.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following packages:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CleverKeyush/Predict-Meteor-Showers.git
   cd meteor-shower-prediction
